I start my work public. I try to generate random words of grammar for checking the open source Ruby grammar.
I suppose that someone going to create a code that parse antlr grammar to my structure. The data structure agreed with G.N. Zholtkevych.

For example I start to work with palindrome's grammar, and the simpliest assumptions.
